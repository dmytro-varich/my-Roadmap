# my-Roadmap
My Roadmap is a project that allows users to dynamically add, edit, and track goals, milestones, and events through an intuitive interface. Unlike static roadmaps that require manual HTML updates, this project offers real-time editing and saves progress using cookies for persistent data storage. Itâ€™s designed to explore modern frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and cookie management, providing a flexible and responsive solution for personal or organizational planning. The overall design and style are inspired by the roadmap template of the [TON organization](https://ton.org/en).
